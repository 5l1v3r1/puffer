          BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND ITS RELATED CONTENT AND SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY, THE "<b>WEBSITE</b>"), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE AND YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE STANFORD STUDY AS DESCRIBED BELOW ("<b>TERMS OF PARTICIPATION</b>").  If you do not agree to the terms of this agreement, please stop using this Website.

          <p class="card-text">
          <b>The Study</b>  You are invited to participate in <b>an academic research study</b> on improving the algorithms used for data transmission and video streaming over the Internet (the "Study").
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
          The Website will stream live broadcast signals that the Stanford research team receives from our local digital antenna in Stanford, CA, to the study participants without any modification whatsoever to the programing content.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
          The <b>purpose of the Study</b> is to figure out how to teach a computer to design new algorithms that reduce glitches and stalls in streaming video (especially over wireless networks and those with limited capacity, such as in rural areas), improve picture quality, and predict more accurately how the capacity of an Internet connection will change over time. As you stream video over your Internet connection, the Website will experiment with different algorithms that control the timing and quality of video sent to you. The Website will automatically collect information from your Web browser, including which video channel was sent to you, the picture quality of that video compared with the original version received by our antenna, the timing and duration of stalls in the playback, the timing of the delivery or loss of individual Internet Protocol datagrams or messages, and the accuracy of predictions the Website makes about the capacity of the Internet connection between you and the Website. You will not receive a survey or be required to answer any questions as part of the Study.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
          This Website was created by the Stanford researchers for the purpose of conducting this academic research Study, and will not be used for any commercial purpose. The information collected by the Website will be used for scientific purposes, including to draft scientific articles submitted for publication or presented at scientific or professional meetings, and to publish open-source software. You will not be individually identified in any publications or software released by the Stanford research team.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
          The Study is limited to participants in the <b>United States</b> only, who are <b>18 or above</b> (each a "Study Participant").  During the Study, no more than <b>500</b> participants may access the Website at any time.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
          <b>Participant's Involvement:</b>  Your participation will take approximately six to nine months. We expect each participant to stream video from the Website for several hours each week.  We reserve the right to terminate your participation if you do not meet the expectation described above, or otherwise violate these Terms of Participation or any applicable laws.
