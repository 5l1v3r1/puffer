      <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
    </div>

    <h5 class="mb-2">What is Puffer?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">Puffer is a Stanford University research study
      about using machine learning to improve video-streaming
      algorithms&mdash;the kind of algorithms used by services such as
      YouTube, Netflix, and Twitch. We are trying to figure out how to
      teach a computer to design new algorithms that reduce glitches
      and stalls in streaming video (especially over wireless networks
      and those with limited capacity, such as in rural areas),
      improve picture quality, and predict how the capacity of an
      Internet connection will change over time.

    <h5 class="mb-2">Sounds interesting&mdash;what can the public do to help?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">Watch TV on this website. Seriously&mdash;the idea of this study
is that you watch TV channels here, streaming them over your Internet
connection, and as you do, the Puffer website will automatically
experiment with different algorithms that control the timing and
quality of video sent to you, and will monitor how well the resulting
computer-designed algorithms work. The more diverse the Internet
connections that study participants use, the better the system will be
able to learn, and the more robust the resulting computer-generated algorithms.

    <h5 class="mb-2">So you're doing a research project to improve video streaming technology, and my role is to watch television on your website?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">Yes. Well, technically you don't even have to
    watch. We just need people to stream video over different kinds of
    Internet connections, so that the computer has some live traffic
    to learn from and experiment on.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">How can I join the study and watch TV on your website?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
Visit the <a role="button" class="btn btn-link" href="{% url 'signup' %}">Sign up</a> page to join. You must be within the United
      States to use Puffer.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Do I have to pay?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">No, there is no charge to participate. Puffer is
an academic project at Stanford University and is entirely
non-profit.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">What channels can I watch?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Puffer re-transmits free over-the-air broadcast television signals received by an antenna
    located on the campus of Stanford University. At the moment, we are re-transmitting local
    affiliates or owned stations of CBS (KPIX 5), NBC (KNTV 11), ABC (KGO 7), FOX (KTVU 2),
    PBS (KQED 9), and Univision (KDTV 14).</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Can you please add HBO/CNN/ESPN?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">No&mdash;we can only re-transmit free over-the-air broadcast television signals.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Why doesn't Puffer work on my computer or smartphone?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Puffer uses the
    Web <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/">Media Source
    Extensions (MSE)</a> to stream video.  This standard is not
    supported by all browsers&mdash;in particular, it is not supported
    by Safari on iOS (and we understand other browser engines are not
    allowed on iOS, which means it is not possible to watch Puffer on
    an iPhone or iPad). Puffer does work in Chrome (including on
    Android phones), Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and the desktop version
    of Safari. If you are having trouble, please contact the research
    team by
    visiting <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/puffer-stanford">the
    puffer-stanford Google Group</a>.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">When you say Puffer will learn better
    video-streaming &ldquo;algorithms.&rdquo;&mdash;which algorithms
    do you mean?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Puffer is focused on three types of algorithms:
      &ldquo;congestion-control&rdquo; algorithms that decide when to
      send each piece of data, also known as a packet, &ldquo;throughput forecasters,&rdquo;
      which predict how long it will take to send a certain amount of data over
      an Internet connection in the near future, and
      &ldquo;adaptive-bitrate&rdquo; (ABR) algorithms that decide what
      quality of video to send, in order to try to give the user the
      best picture quality that won't lead to a stall or
      rebuffer. All three kinds of algorithms have a long history of work
      by academics and practitioners.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Why do you need a website with 500 people streaming video from you to do this research?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The core issue here is that developing robust systems takes data
      and experience. Big companies (e.g., YouTube, Netflix, Twitch)
      have lots of users, which means lots of data: they could, at least
      in theory, do experiments where some users get one variant of an
      algorithm for a day, and some get a different variant, and at
      the end of the day there is tons of data to decide which variant
      is better to the bottom-line metrics (generally in terms of
      things like stalls and startup speed, picture quality and the
      variation in quality over time, and cost or wasted bandwidth).
    </p>

    <p>
      The challenge for the big companies is that they are generally
      pretty conservative about changing their low-level systems code,
      like congestion-control algorithms and throughput prediction
      algorithms. Letting a machine learn these algorithms online, by
      running a new experiment every hour or so, seems to be a nonstarter for
      these services&mdash;there's too much at risk.</p>

    <p>Academics, on the other hand, historically have had to develop
    network algorithms
      <a href="http://mit.edu/remy">in simulation</a> or
      in <a href="https://pantheon.stanford.edu">small real-world
      testbeds</a>&mdash;sometimes known as &ldquo;offline&rdquo; learning.
    Unfortunately, we have learned through experience that
      algorithms learned in simulation or in small-scale experiments
      sometimes aren't able to replicate their performance in the real
      world, or even in subsequent small-scale experiments. We're
      not sure if it's possible to learn a network algorithm in
      simulation and have it perform robustly on real traffic over the
      real-world Internet. (Nobody has figured out how to do this
      yet&mdash;which probably indicates a failure of our simulations,
      but it's not obvious where.) To teach a machine to develop
      robust algorithms automatically, academics need a real
      population of Internet connections we can experiment on.</p>

<p>Puffer is attempting to answer the question of whether rapid
      &ldquo;online&rdquo; learning&mdash;automatically generating and
      testing algorithms on real users <strong>in
      situ</strong>&mdash;can successfully produce robust systems.
      Hence this website: a medium-sized video streaming
      website, open to the public, run for academic purposes, that learns
low-level systems algorithms as a function of who is using it.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Why are you streaming over-the-air television?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
      For the research project to work, we
      need <strong>some</strong> source of video that never ends and
      is sufficiently interesting to attract a few hundred people to
      watch. Broadcast TV is the most interesting thing that we have access to
      and are permitted to retransmit.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Who is responsible for Puffer?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
    The Puffer project is led
    by <a href="https://platformlab.stanford.edu/student-francis-yan.php">Francis
    Yan</a>, a doctoral student in computer science at Stanford
    University, along with Sadjad Fouladi and Hudson Ayers (also
    Stanford) and Chenzhi Zhu (Tsinghua University). The project is
    advised by
    professors <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw">Keith
    Winstein</a> and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pal">Philip
    Levis</a>.</p>

    <p>The project has been funded in part by the NSF and DARPA,
    along with support from Google, Huawei, VMware, Dropbox, Facebook,
    and the Stanford Platform Lab.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Does the research group behind Puffer have any past work in this area?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We have recently published work
on <a href="https://pantheon.stanford.edu">neural networks and a
standardized training ground for congestion control</a> and
on <a href="https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify">better systems for
real-time Internet video</a> and
on <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi17/technical-sessions/presentation/fouladi">high-speed
video encoding using thousands of tiny threads</a>. In earlier days,
the advisor was responsible for work
in <a href="https://mit.edu/remy">computer-generated congestion
control</a> and in <a href="https://alfalfa.mit.edu">forecasting the
speed of an Internet connection for video</a>
and <a href="https://mosh.org">integrating application coding and
congestion control</a>.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">What information do you collect about me?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">As you stream video, the Puffer website will automatically collect information from your Web browser, including which video channel was sent to you, the picture quality of that video compared with the original version received by our antenna, the timing and duration of stalls in the playback, the timing of the delivery or loss of individual Internet Protocol datagrams or messages, and the accuracy of predictions the Website makes about the capacity of the Internet connection between you and the Website.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Is there a survey to fill out?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">No&mdash;you will not receive a survey or be
    required to answer any questions as part of the study.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Does this study count as &mdash;human-subjects research&mdash;?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">No&mdash;the Stanford University Institutional Review Board has determined
that this project does not meet the definition of human subjects research as defined in federal
regulations 45 C.F.R. § 46.102 or 21 C.F.R. § 50.3.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">I lost my password&mdash;can I reset it?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">No&mdash;Puffer doesn't collect any private information about research subjects,
not even their email addresses. As a result, it is not possible to reset a lost password. If the Puffer website
is still accepting new research subjects, you can try to create a new account.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">What are the limitations on study participants?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">You must be within the United States to use
Puffer. The study is limited to 500 participants at a time. We expect
each participant to stream video from the Website for several hours
each week, and we reserve the right to terminate your participation if
you do not meet this expectation. You can't copy, distribute,
rebroadcast, etc., anything you receive from us. Please <a href="{%
url 'signup' %}">read the formal Terms of Participation</a> before signing up.

    <h5 class="mb-2">Do you have any nerdy graphs showing how the system is working?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">Sure, check out our <a href="https://puffer.stanford.edu/monitoring/">public monitoring</a>.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Video streaming already works&mdash;isn't this a solved problem?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
      It does work for a lot of
      people! <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46403.pdf">Google
      has published</a> that 93\% of YouTube sessions <strong>never
      stall to rebuffer</strong>. Whether this means video streaming
      is a solved problem somewhat depends on your perspective. If you
      are on a wireless connection or in a rural area, your results
      are probably worse. And video streaming necessarily involves a
      tradeoff between picture quality and the risk of stall. If you
      care about the picture quality (and not just whether the video
      plays without stalling to rebuffer), your demands probably
      increase with time&mdash;especially as video grows to greater
      resolutions and sizes, so even today's wired networks will prove
      inadequate in the future.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">
    Puffer is unique from previous academic studies on video streaming in that it
    uses <i>online</i> learning to generate adaptive bit rate (ABR) and congestion control
    algorithms. In essence, this means that Puffer regularly learns from past performance to
    construct future algorithms which work better. Ultimately, we hope that this
    approach will produce substantial benefits over prior work&mdash;but only time will tell.
    Beyond this fundamental difference, Puffer also approaches the video-streaming problem
    differently in a number of ways. These include:
    <ul>
        <li>Puffer's use of structural similarity (SSIM) instead of bitrate
            as the input to quality of experience measurements, ensuring performance measurements
            are more directly linked to user experience. </li>
        <li>Puffer's use of a denser bitrate ladder than most existing systems, allowing for more fine-grained
            control of video quality received by users. </li>
        <li>Use of websockets instead of HTTP request/response, allowing for continuous streaming video
          that is not synchronous with client requests.</li>
        <li>Using congestion control with a tunable pacing rate and a direct access to a throughput estimate,
            instead of having all testing occur on top of TCP.</li>
        <li>Verbose communication between the congestion control layer and the application layer,
            so that application layer decision about video quality can be informed by the bandwidth
            available in the congestion control layer</li>
        <li>The use of nontraditional signals to train our transmission-time predictor, such as ISP, connectivity
            type, etc.</li>
        <li>Using a direct Transmission Time Predictor (which predicts the time required to send a chunk of a certain coded length) instead of simply extrapolating a unitary throughput estimate</li>
        <li>Retraining the Transmission Time Predictor day-by-day as a function of real data</li>
        <li>Automatically generating variants of the ABR scheme, and evolving them day-by-day as a function of real data</li>
        <li>Using joint control across different users vs. treating each flow separately</li>.
    </ul>
