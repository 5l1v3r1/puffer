    </div>

    <h5 class="mb-2">What is Puffer?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">Puffer is a Stanford University research project aiming to improve live
    streaming of video over the Internet. </p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">How can I sign up?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Puffer is limiting growth to ensure we do not overwhelm our research-oriented infrastructure.
    To do so, we require that users possess invitation tokens in order to create new accounts.
    To request an invitation token <a href="{% url 'participate' %}">visit this page.</a>
    Finally, please keep in mind that Puffer is only available to users in the United States.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">What channels can I watch?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Puffer rebroadcasts over-the-air television channels available in the Bay Area. Currently,
    we rebroadcast local affiliates of CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, Univision, and PBS.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">What makes Puffer unique?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Puffer is unique from previous academic studies on video streaming in that it
    uses <i>online</i> learning to generate adaptive bit rate (ABR) and congestion control
    algorithms. In essence, this means that Puffer regularly learns from past performance to
    construct future algorithms which work better. Ultimately, we believe that such an
    approach will produce substantial benefits over prior work, and create a system
    which is much more robust to dramatic changes in network characteristics over time.
    Beyond this fundamental difference, Puffer also approaches the video-streaming problem
    differently in a number of other ways. These include:
    <ul>
        <li>Puffer's use of structural similarity (SSIM) instead of bitrate
            as the input to quality of experience measurements, ensuring performance measurements
            are more directly linked to user experience. </li>
        <li>Puffer's use of a denser bitrate ladder than most existing systems, allowing for more fine-grained
            control of video quality received by users. </li>
        <li>Use of websockets instead of HTTP request/response, allowing for full duplex communication
            between client and server.</li>
        <li>Using congestion control with a tunable pacing rate and a direct access to a throughput estimate,
            instead of having all testing occur on top of TCP.</li>
        <li>Verbose communication between the congestion control layer and the application layer,
            such that application layer decision about video quality can be informed by the bandwidth
            available in the congestion control layer</li>
        <li>The use of nontraditional signals to train our transmission-time predictor, such as ISP, connectivity
            type, and more.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Does Puffer cost money?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Nope! Puffer is completely free.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Why doesn't Puffer work on my device?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Puffer relies on HTML5 Media Source Extensions (MSE) to stream adaptive audio and video to users.
    This is a relatively new technology, and is not yet supported by all browsers. Most
    notably, <i>no iOS browsers currently support MSE</i> (though most Android browsers do).
    Our project is more focused on providing a uniform research surface than on supporting
    a fallback for non-MSE supported browsers (as YouTube does), so support for
    Puffer in these browsers is dependent on MSE support being introduced in those browsers.
    <br>
    Even beyond MSE, some other browser incompatibilities may exist, but we are doing our best
    to maintain support for combinations of major desktop operating systems and major browsers,
    such as Mac/Windows/Linux combined with Chrome/Firefox/Edge, as well as most Android browsers.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Does Puffer work better than other live TV services?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Puffer is still in the early stages of evaluation, and will regularly assign
    different users to different combinations of streaming algorithms, some of which may
    work better than others. This algorithmic churn is necessary for Puffer to learn
    what serves users well and what does not; we hope that over time Puffer will
    learn viewer-specific algorithms that work extremely well. However, some of this
    churn may also mean that Puffer at times does not work as well other live tv services
    which you may have used, and your patience with Puffer is greatly appreciated.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-2">Why do you need real users?</h5>
    <p class="mb-4">Many prior studies of video streaming exist which rely primarily on simulation
    based evaluation or artificial testbed based evaluation, such as
    <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/hongzi/content/publications/Pensieve-Sigcomm17.pdf">Pensieve</a>,
    <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xia/resources/Documents/Yin_sigcomm15.pdf" >MPC</a>, and
    <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~isl/papers/sigcomm18-final128.pdf">Oboe.</a>
    Our study is unique in that it investigates the merits of <i>online</i> learning, as described above.
    Our system is capable of learning over a vastly greater number of inputs
    than simple network characteristics, and we hope it can demonstrate that it is robust to dramatic
    changes in network characteristics over time. However, this approach of using online learning
    depends on our ability to evaluate and train our system on real users over real-world networks.
    Finally, given that our system varies congestion control
    algorithms in addition to ABR algorithms, it is important that we can evaluate how our congestion
    control algorithms interact with other congestion control algorithms on real networks, which can
    be difficult to evaluate in simulation.
